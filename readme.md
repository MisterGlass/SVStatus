This is a basic visualizer for my AIs progress in Schemaverse, the space-based strategy game implemented entirely within a PostgreSQL database (https://schemaverse.com/).

Logs are saved in a local MySQL database by my AI (not included) every turn, and this displays some vital statistics in (near) real time. 

You can view this live and operating at http://yair.silbermintz.com/schemaverse/svStatus.php
